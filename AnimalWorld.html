	</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;background-color: white;color: blue;">Our dark oceans are home to millions of known and mysterious specifies, the many wonders of underwater sea-creatures. However, the giant Pacific octopus is truly something magnificent. With three hearts, nine brains, and blue blood these eight-armed creatures are nothing short of extraordinary. One main brain controls their nervous system with eight smaller brains controlling each of their eight arms. Two hearts pump blood to their gills with one larger heart circulating blood to the rest of the body. They can also camouflage for protection when hunting for food and release a toxic ink when alarmed. Fascinating, right?</p>

				<i>4.Wild chimpanzees enjoy getting tipsy</i>
			</u>
		</b>
	</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;background-color: lightgrey;color: darkorchid;">Just like humans, chimpanzees like to get tipsy from alcohol. Over the years, researchers have discovered an evolutionary connection between humans consuming alcohol, and chimps searching for naturally fermented alcohol. It's called the 'Drunken Monkey Hypothesis'. In the Guinea jungle, these intelligent wild chimps have been climbing the raffia palm trees to steal the alcoholic sap that humans have been collected in containers. The total alcohol amount in this fermented palm sap averages at 3 percent, equivalent to a small beer! </p>
